# Bank-Markting

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a **Bank Marketing** dataset to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and behavioral data. The dataset contains information from direct marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese bank.

## 🔍 Dataset
- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing)
- **Features**:
  - Client-related attributes (age, job, marital status, etc.)
  - Campaign-related data (contact method, previous attempts, etc.)
  - Economic indicators (consumer confidence index, employment rate, etc.)
- **Target**: `y` (whether the client subscribed to a term deposit: `yes` or `no`)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib)
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and visualization

## 🖥️ Code Structure
The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and follows a structured approach:

1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**
   - Load the dataset using pandas.
   - Handle missing values and perform basic cleaning.
   - Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize key distributions using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
   - Identify correlations and trends in the data.
   - Perform feature importance analysis.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Scale numerical features using StandardScaler.
   - Create new features based on domain knowledge.
   - Apply dimensionality reduction techniques if needed.

4. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
   - Tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
   - Evaluate models using classification metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score).

5. **Results Interpretation & Insights**
   - Compare model performances.
   - Identify key features that impact the prediction.
   - Provide business insights based on findings.

6. **Future Improvements & Deployment**
   - Optimize model performance further.
   - Deploy the model using a Streamlit-based web app.

## 🚀 How to Run
