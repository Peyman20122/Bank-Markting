# Bank-Markting

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a **Bank Marketing** dataset to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and behavioral data. The dataset contains information from direct marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese bank.

## 🔍 Dataset
- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing)
- **Features**:
  - Client-related attributes (age, job, marital status, etc.)
  - Campaign-related data (contact method, previous attempts, etc.)
  - Economic indicators (consumer confidence index, employment rate, etc.)
- **Target**: `y` (whether the client subscribed to a term deposit: `yes` or `no`)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib)
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and visualization

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bank-marketing.git
   cd bank-marketing
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook bank-marketing.ipynb
   ```

## 📊 Key Insights
- Identified the most important features influencing customer subscription.
- Applied feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
- Achieved **high accuracy and recall**, making the model useful for targeted marketing campaigns.

## ✨ Future Improvements
- Implement a web-based interface using **Streamlit**.
- Enhance feature selection using SHAP values.
- Optimize the model further with deep learning techniques.
